## Docker Group Privilege Escalation

If you have docker group privileges, then you can easily get root:

In docker, you have a `-v` (bind mount a volume) option. This means you can bind the root directory to a place in a docker container. So you can basically “import” the root directory of the host OS to some place in a docker container (like `/mnt/someplace`):

```
Docker run -v /:/mnt/someplace -it <container-name> bash
```

So when you navigate to `/mnt/someplace` **inside the docker container**, you will be able to read (and write I think?) the files as root, since you are root in the docker container.

## LXD Group Privilege Escalation

Pretty much the same method works if you're in the lxd group.
