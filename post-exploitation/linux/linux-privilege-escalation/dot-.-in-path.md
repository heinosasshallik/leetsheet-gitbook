# Dot (.) In PATH

Example of a **vulnerable** PATH. Note the dot in the front:

```
.:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin
```

If a user named `admin` has the above PATH, then if you put a malicious executable named `ls` in a folder the `admin` user frequently visits, then if they type `ls` into their terminal while they are in that folder, theyâ€™ll execute your program.

If the dot is at the **end** of the PATH, then exploitation is slightly more difficult, since the `ls` executable in `/usr/bin/ls` will be found before `./ls` is found, and `/usr/bin/ls` will be executed instead of your malicious `./ls`. In that case, you can add a `./sl` executable and hope that the `admin` user makes a typo.
