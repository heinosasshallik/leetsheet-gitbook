## Automatic Privilege Escalation Enumeration

LinPEAS is the best enumeration script.

## Process Monitoring

You can use pspy to monitor cronjobs and active processes - even those which normally you wouldn’t be able to see. However it isn’t all-powerful. For example, if another user uses `ps aux` then it captures that, but it doesn’t capture `tar cf a.tar *`, for example.&#x20;

Pspy is a statically compiled binary, so you can just download it and run it.
