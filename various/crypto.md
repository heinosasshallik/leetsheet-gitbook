# Crypto

## Vignere Cipher&#x20;

If you know some ciphertext and you know the corresponding plaintext, then you can use [this website](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to get the key. Just input the ciphertext into the ciphertext field and the corresponding plaintext into the “knowing the key/password” field. The result will be the actual key used to cipher the text.&#x20;

The key will be repeating (it will be the same length as the ciphertext). For example, in the Brainfuck hackthebox lab, the result was FUCKMYBRAINFUCKMYBRAINFUCKMYBRAIN, meaning the key is FUCKMYBRAIN.
