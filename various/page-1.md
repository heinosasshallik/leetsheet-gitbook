## Creation

### Evading Antivirus

For hiding your executable from AV, shellter is better than msfvenom. Also you can use Veil along with iexpress.exe

You can use PS2EXE to convert a powershell script to an executable - makes it easy to download a payload from the internet and execute it.

Meta-twin is a tool that copies the metadata (including the signature, though it will no longer be valid) from an application to your payload. For example, before using this tool, 95% of antiviruses detected the PS2EXE executable as malware. After using this tool, the number dropped significantly (for example windows defender couldnt detect anymore)

Invoke-obfuscation is a powershell command obfuscator.

### Persistence

To have persistence on a machine, you could use WMI-persistence from github. It uses WMI events for fileless persistence

## Drop Vectors

### Windows Settings Shortcut RCE

June 2018 - getting a victim to download and execute a Windows Settings Shortcut file leads to RCE. This can be placed in an Office file, as itâ€™s new and thus not in the blacklist (it is, however, blocked from Microsoft office365 since 11. July 2018).
