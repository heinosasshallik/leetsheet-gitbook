# SQL Injection

### Manual Testing

How to test for SQL Injection manually.

#### Verify the Existence of SQL Injection

Broadly, to verify the existence of SQL injection in a given field you can try to either:

1. Create an error
2. Use SQL operators and see if the data is changed according to SQL rules
3. Cause the add a `sleep` statement to the SQL query

To **create an error**, you can:

* Add single and double quotes everywhere and see if it fails
* If there is an integer ID, then you can try a negative value, since negative IDs usually don't exist

Using **operators**, you can verify SQL like this:

* If there is an integer ID, then you can try to subtract from it.
  * `?id=11-1`, and see if the result is the same as `?id=10`
* If there is a string value, then that's trickier. You can try to concatenate to it, but it's easy to create an error accidentally.
  * `asd' + 'f` will work in MySQL, but not in PostgreSQL
  * `asd' || 'f` is the SQL standard, but it will **still create an error** in MySQL, because MySQL expects it in between a pair of parentheses.
