# File Inclusion

File Inclusion allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application. Most commonly found in **PHP** applications.

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)

LFI happens when an attacker can include files on the vulnerable server (as opposed to being able to include files from remote servers). [Path Traversal](path-traversal.md) techniques can often be useful when exploiting local file inclusion vulnerabilities.
