# File Inclusion

File Inclusion allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a "dynamic file inclusion" mechanisms implemented in the target application. Most commonly found in **PHP** applications.&#x20;

For example, think of file inclusion when you see:

* page.php?file=some-file-here
* page.php?language=eng

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)

LFI happens when an attacker can include files on the vulnerable server (as opposed to being able to include files from remote servers). [Path Traversal](path-traversal.md) techniques can often be useful when exploiting local file inclusion vulnerabilities.

For example, let's say you have the page `page.php?language=en` and that page includes the `page.en.php` file. If `language=fr`, then it would include `page.fr.php`.

In that case, you can include the `malicious.php` file in the same directory with `page.php?language=en/../malicious`. If you had managed to upload a `malicious.php` file using [unrestricted file upload](page-3.md), then that will result in an RCE vulnerability.
