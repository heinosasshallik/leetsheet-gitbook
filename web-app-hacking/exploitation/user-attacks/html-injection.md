# HTML Injection

Occurs when you can inject HTML, but not Javascript for whatever reason.

### Steal Cookies

I havenâ€™t tested this, but HTML5 allows for `<img>` tags with CORS cross-origin use-credentials. This would allow you to steal cookies if you have a website that accepts CORS-with-credentials requests and logs the cookies.
