# Session Fixation

Occurs when one person can set another person’s session token. Usually this happens when session tokens are accepted in GET or POST data.

**Example Attack scenario**

An attacker gives the victim a link and the victim goes to it \(`vulnerable.com/sid=I_GAVE_YOU_THIS_SID`\). It prompts for a login. If on login, the victim has the session id `I_GAVE_YOU_THIS_SID`, then it’s bad. The attacker who gave the sid can log in with that session id.

`I_GAVE_YOU_THIS_SID` should ideally be a server-generated session id \(a session id that was generated for the attacker by the server\) so you can be sure that it's in the correct format.
