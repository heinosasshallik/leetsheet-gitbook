## XSSable Locations

### In the Document

XSS can occur as a result of the following things:

* The attacker can inject certain HTML tags
  * The simplest example is the `<script>` tag, but others can also work, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
* The attacker can inject text in between certain tags or in certain fields
  * The same as above, but instead of injecting the tag, the tag already exists, and the attacker is able to write text in between the tag.
  * For example, there's a `<img src=ATTACKER_INPUT_HERE>` tag, and the attacker injects `x onerror=alert(1)`
* The attacker can inject a malicious URL.
  * For example, `<a href="javascript:alert(1)">click me</a>`
